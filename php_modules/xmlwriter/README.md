# xmlwriter

This is the XMLWriter extension. It wraps the libxml xmlWriter API.

This extension represents a writer that provides a non-cached, forward-only means of generating streams or files containing XML data.

This extension can be used in an object-oriented style or a procedural one. Every method documented describes the alternative procedural call.
